        <p><strong>Q. Do I have to register to be able to TopUp my phone online?</strong><br>Yes, all users are
            required to register for the service. Details such as username and email address are required</p>
        <p><strong>Q. Why do I need to have an email address?</strong><br>When you register, an activation link to
            the site and code will be sent to the email address that was registered. Your account will not be active
            and your user name and password will not work until the link is activated. Also if you forget your
            password, reminders will be sent to that address too.</p>
        <p><strong>Q. I registered successfully and then tried to login and my details were not
            accepted?</strong><br>After registering, you will need to go to your registered email account and
            retrieve a welcome email. That email will contain an activation link which you will need to click onto
            to activate your account. Until you do that, your account will be locked. That is just required once.
